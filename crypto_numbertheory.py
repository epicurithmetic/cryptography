# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Code for doing arithmetic in GF(2) and its finite extensions. For cryptography
# purposes a lot of work is done in GF(256). But code should be written for
# any finite extension of GF(2).

# When working in such an extension we must realise it has a quotient of the
# polynomial ring with coefficients in GF(2). For that, we have to *choose*
# an irreducible polynomial to quotient by for each GF(n).

# In the case of implementing the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) block
# cipher one is required to use the following specified polynomial.

#           AES-Specficication: f(x) = x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1

# Polynomials over GF(2) have coefficients consiting of 0 or 1. Together with
# the powers of x. However, the powers of x are really just place holders.
# For this reason, we can (and will) represent a polynomial simply as a binary
# string. The coefficient of the highest power of x will be the left-most entry
# of the string, and they will descend along to the constant term at the right.

# Example: x^3 + x + 1 is represented as '1011'. The 0 represents the fact that
#          there are no x^2 terms. Each 1 represents the 1 in front of the other
#          terms of the polynomial.

# With this choice of notation made, we can now write functions which perform
# arithmetic on polynomials over GF(2). In particular we require functions
# which (i) add polynomials (ii) multiply polynomials (iii) calculate the
# remainder upon divison of one polynomial by another, and (iv) the greatest
# common divisor of two polynomials.

# Ideas: Use a polynomial to define an object in a class Algebraic Integers
#        This class could have functions (methods) which give information about
#        the monogenic ring this polynomial generates.
#        (i) is it the ring of integers of the field?
#       (ii) what is the group of units?
#      (iii) which primes ramify?
#       (iv) ... other number theoretically interesting things?

# Define a class whose objects are rings of algebraic integers whose type
# is a class so that one can then refer to the elements of that ring as
# the objects of the class defining the ring. Elements of the ring will be
# an object with in a class with in a class.
